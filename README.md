# peanut.one

The code for my personal website. Added onto over time and containing several small subprojects.

## main page

At the site's landing page (https://peanut.one) you can upload small files to retrieve later. The site was borne out of a need to copy a zip file between two computers easily, when I didn't have a flash drive handy. Filesize is limited for cost reasons but please, feel free to try it out!

## twitchapp

Small webapp that shows you who among your followed channels is currently live! It formats it into a nice little table with links to go watch (and be sure to try hovering over the channel names)!

Just visit `https://twitch.peanut.one/user/<yourusernamehere>`
